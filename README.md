# Hello! my name is Felipe

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Full-Stack/Front-end developer
- I'm a Front-end developer with a passion for creating immersive web experiences, I'm currently studying to become Full-stack 🌱. <br>
- I'm constantly improving my JavaScript skills and exploring the latest technologies to ensure my projects stand out. In addition to development, I have a special interest in design, you can see it in my own programming projects.

## About me
I had contact with programming from an early age 👶🏻, in my high school I studied Internet Computing at IFPE, where I was able to learn various concepts of web development. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at UFRPE, where I am strengthening my foundation in computer science to prepare for a career as a full-stack developer in the future.
